# Overview

I built a simple To-Do List app in C# to practice basic programming skills. The goal was to get better at using C# by creating something useful. This app lets users add, view, and remove tasks, and it saves the tasks to a file so they don't disappear when the program is closed.

The point of this project was to get hands-on experience with C# syntax, lists, file operations, and user input.

# Development Environment

I used Visual Studio to write the code, which is a great IDE for C#. The app was built using C# with basic libraries like System.IO for file saving/loading and System.Collections.Generic for managing tasks with a list.

# Useful Websites

These sites helped me during development:

- [C# Documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/)
- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)

# Future Work

Hereâ€™s what I plan to add or improve in the future:

- Add task prioritization (like high, medium, low).
- Add a way to mark tasks as "in progress."
- Make a GUI version with buttons and windows instead of the console.
